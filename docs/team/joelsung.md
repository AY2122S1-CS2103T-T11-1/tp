### Project: NUS Tracker

NUS Tracker - (to include description of project here)

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create Events for students to enroll in.
  * Highlights: This feature was challenging to implement as a brand new entity/class was introduced to the application. That required the AddressBook to now contain an event list, the GUI had to display the event list, the storage had to now store events and utility test classes had to be created to test event related classes and functions.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete Events
  * Hightlights: The DeleteCommand was made into an abstract class which DeleteStudentCommand and DeleteEventCommand inherit from. The DeleteCommandParser had to now account for the difference.
