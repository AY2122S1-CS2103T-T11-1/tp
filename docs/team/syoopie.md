### Project: NUSTracker
* **New Feature**: export
  * What it does: Allows a user to export the emails of the current list of students that are being displayed
  * Justification: To allow user to easily acquire a file consisting of relevant emails so that they can copy it and email a large number of people at once.
  * Highlights: Had to conform with the original implementations of file/memory access implemented in AB3, also had to create a new class in storage component to manage the file creation and writing aspect of the exporting function

<br>

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Maintained the help function, updated it with all the new features implemented
  * Improved the GUI of the help function, make it easy for the user to copy commands to assist those who are more unfamiliar with the app
  * Changed help window to use a dropdown box instead to accommodate for our growing list of commands
  * Did a full refactoring of Person -> Student to bring the language of the code more in line with our project
  * Constantly maintained the userGuide and made changes and updates for it to conform with our actual implementation

<br>

* **Community**:
  * Helped with PR reviews and pushed for merging to forward the progress of the application
  * Pointed out bugs / cosmetic issues in peers code and approached them to correct it
