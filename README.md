This is the Team Project for CS2103T, done by T11-1.

The code is adapted from **[Address Book](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)** which provides a **reasonably
well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.

We present NUSTracker. This application targets events directors / administrative personnel of NUS student organizations.

We aim to address these problems:
1. Easier management of NUSâ€™s huge undergraduate base.
2. Store event details and attendance information all in 1 app.
3. Convenient event management.
